## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Smart Contract Issues
- Verify contract is verified on Basescan
- Check wallet has enough ETH for gas
- Ensure correct contract address in env
- Review transaction errors in explorer

### Payment Issues
- Verify Stripe webhook is receiving events
- Check webhook signature validation
- Review Stripe dashboard for errors
- Test with Stripe CLI locally

### IPFS Upload Failures
- Check Web3.storage API limits
- Verify file size < 100MB
- Ensure proper file format (PNG/JPG)
- Check network connectivity

### Email Delivery Problems
- Verify SMTP credentials
- Check spam folder
- Review email service logs
- Test with different providers

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
- Daily active artists
- Artworks uploaded per day
- Successful purchases
- Failed transactions
- Email delivery rate
- Download completion rate

### Where to Monitor
- Supabase dashboard for database
- Stripe dashboard for payments
- Web3.storage dashboard for storage
- Vercel/hosting analytics
- Smart contract on Basescan

## ðŸš¨ Emergency Procedures

### If Payments Fail
1. Check Stripe status page
2. Verify webhook is responding
3. Review recent deployments
4. Enable Stripe test mode temporarily

### If IPFS Goes Down
1. Images will still load from cache
2. Disable new uploads temporarily
3. Consider backup storage provider
4. Monitor Web3.storage status

### If Contract Has Issues
1. Contract is non-upgradeable
2. Can pause minting if needed
3. Deploy new contract if critical
4. Migrate existing data

## ðŸ“ˆ Scaling Considerations

At 1,000+ artworks:
- Implement image CDN
- Add database indexes
- Enable caching layer

At 10,000+ users:
- Upgrade Supabase plan
- Implement queuing for uploads
- Add load balancer

## ðŸŽ‰ Launch Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Security audit complete
- [ ] Legal terms added
- [ ] Analytics configured
- [ ] Social media announced
- [ ] Support email ready
- [ ] Monitoring alerts set
